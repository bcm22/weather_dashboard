# Weather_Dashboard

## Discription

I built this application to show how you can dynamically use javascript to inject data into HTML to create a function weather application. 

This application is used to show the weather forcast for the current and the next 5 days depending on what city you type in the search field. 

## Usage

To use this application type in the your desired city and press search. Once the search button is pressed you will see the current days weather temp, wind speed and humidity. You will also see a 5 day forcast with the aforementioned data as well.
